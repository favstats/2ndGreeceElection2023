### Methodology


In collaboration with [Who Targets Me](https://whotargets.me/), we monitored 584 political advertisers in Greece during the 2nd 2023 Greek legislative election to better understand how campaigns use different targeting methods made available by Meta. To do this, we used data from the [Meta Ad Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/), using the new 'Audience' data which gives some detail on how pages target their ads. 

To better understand the election, we kept only advertisers who:

1. Advertised in the last 7 days (Jun 11th - Jun 17th 2023)
2. Advertised in the last 30 days (May 19th - Jun 17th 2023)


::: {.callout-note}
Meta only provides 7, 30 and 90 days windows for the targeting data in their Ad Library. Meta's data also lags by a few days. Report will be updated as soon as new data is available.

## Disclaimer

The data shown in this dashboard is based on the platform's respective ad libraries which are known to be sometimes incomplete ([Edelson et al. 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9152626?casa_token=X9SB7c8W9rAAAAAA:ymZr9ynFNTU6Fjzg3dcQpBzZpJ8bsEfj-H0RVTu2EZafKjhcD5Zu_VQ0aJc6qi9OMks3mUdFs-g); [Silva et al. 2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380109?casa_token=ddoyvLl4R5YAAAAA:JqVLRLe6GHlR2o4zZqbEMlReyuTTyQxCGteUkdcFMR0xuCYWgwdl3NKyK05REOZm8vYl_W-bjOEaepM)). For this reason the data shown here might not reflect the full picture nor all political ads that were targeted at voters.
